###What is Materialize?

 "A modern responsive front-end framework based on Material Design"
 
* Material Design is a design language that combines the classic principles of successful design along with innovation and technology.
* Three Design Principles of Material:
	* Material is the metaphor. 
		* Surfaces and edges of the material provide visual cues that are grounded in reality
		* Realistic lighting shows seams, divides space, and indicates moving parts
	* Bold, graphic, intentional.
		* takes cues from contemporary architecture, road signs, pavement marking tape, and athletic courts. Color should be unexpected and vibrant.
	* Motion provides meaning.
		* Guided focus between views
		* Hints at what will happen if a user completes a gesture
* Created by four students at Carnegie Mellon University
